# Contributing
So you want to contribute? Yay! Great! Fun! I love seeing new PRs for DoiT. That being said, not every pull request will be merged. The general guidelines I'll follow are:

Does it make developing DoiT easier?
Does it help other platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) work better?
Does it fix a bug?
Does it break anything?
Does it stick to the original goal of DoiT (a simple, meter-based to-do list)
Does it reduce the build size?
Is it necessary?
Regarding that last point, I don't expect all pull requests to be absolutely necessary. The new features are good. That being said, if the new features make the app unnecessarily complex in some way without bringing value to the users, it won't be merged.

Please don't be hurt if your PR isn't merged. You're lovely for working on it. If you are thinking about working on something, feel free to make an issue beforehand so that you can make sure it'll be worth your time!
